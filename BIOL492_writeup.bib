However, with the plummeting costs of next-generation sequencing and the addition of genomic selection to the plant breeder{\textquoteright}s toolbox, we now can more efficiently tap the genetic diversity within large germplasm collections. In this study, we applied and evaluated genomic selection{\textquoteright}s potential to a set of 482 pea accessions, genotyped with 30,600 SNP markers and phenotyped for seed yield and yield-related components, for enhancing selection of accessions from the USDA Pea Germplasm Collection. Genomic prediction models and several factors affecting predictive ability were evaluated in a series of cross-validation schemes across complex traits. Different genomic prediction models gave similar results, with predictive ability across traits ranging from 0.23 to 0.60, with no model working best across all traits. Increasing the training population size improved the predictive ability of most traits, including seed yield. An increasing trend in predictive ability was also observed with an increasing number of SNPs. Accounting for population structure effects did not significantly boost predictive ability, but we observed a slight improvement in seed yield. By applying the genomic prediction model from this study, we then examined the distribution of nonphenotyped accessions, and the reliability of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) of the USDA Pea accessions genotyped but not phenotyped. The distribution of GEBV suggested that none of the nonphenotyped accessions were expected to perform outside the range of the phenotyped accessions. Desirable breeding values with higher reliability can be used to identify and screen favorable germplasm accessions. Expanding the training set and incorporating additional orthogonal information into the genomic prediction framework could enhance prediction accuracy.

Lentil genotypes were examined for phenological traits related to adaptation, and recommendations for potential incorporation of new exotic genotypes into Nepalese breeding programs are presented. In addition, predictions of days to flowering based on temperature and photoperiod are used to identify genotypes that hold suitability for specific growing regions in Nepal, allowing for the potential expansion of growing regions. From this study we found many potentially adapted genotypes for terai, mid-hill and high hill growing regions, the list consists of a number of large-seeded lines with yellow cotyledons, an entirely new market class of lentils in Nepal.

  }breeding and is being encouraged for crop breeding. Several statistical models are used to implement GS; however, none have been tested for use in lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) breeding. This study was conducted to compare the accuracy of different GS models and prediction scenarios based on empirical data and to make recommendations for designing genomic selection strategies for lentil breeding. We evaluated nine single-trait (ST) models, two multiple-trait (MT) models, and a model that incorporates genotype × environment interaction (GEI) using populations from a lentil diversity panel and two recombinant inbred lines (RILs). The lines in all populations were phenotyped for five phenological traits and genotyped using a custom exome capture assay. Within-population, across-population, and across-environment genomic predictions were made. Prediction accuracy varied among the evaluated models, populations, prediction scenarios, and traits. Single-trait models showed similar accuracy in the absence of large effect quantitative trait loci (QTL) but BayesB outperformed all models when there were QTL with relatively large effects. Models that accounted for GEI and MT-GS models increased prediction accuracy for a low heritability trait by up to 66 and 14\%, respectively. Moderate to high accuracies were obtained for within-population (range of .36–.85) and across-environment (range of .19–.89) predictions but across-population prediction accuracy was very low. Results suggest that GS can be implemented in lentil breeding to make predictions within populations and across environments, but across-population prediction should not be considered when the population size is small.},

abstract = {Stem rust of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks. and E. Henn. is a globally important disease that can cause severe yield loss. Breeding for quantitative stem rust resistance (QSRR) is important for developing cultivars with durable resistance. Genomic selection (GS) could increase rates of genetic gain for quantitative traits, but few experiments comparing GS and phenotypic selection (PS) have been conducted. Our objectives were to (i) compare realized gain from GS based on markers only with that of PS for QSRR in spring wheat using equal selection intensities; (ii) determine if gains agree with theoretical expectations; and (iii) compare the impact of GS and PS on inbreeding, genetic variance, and correlated response for pseudo-black chaff (PBC), a correlated trait. Over 2 yr, two cycles of GS were performed in parallel with one cycle of PS, with each method replicated twice. For GS, markers were generated using genotyping-by-sequencing, the prediction model was initially trained using historical data, and the model was updated before the second GS cycle. Overall, GS and PS led to a 31 ± 11 and 42 ± 12\% increase in QSRR and a 138 ± 22 and 180 ± 70\% increase in PBC, respectively. Genetic gains were not significant but were in agreement with expectations. Per year, gains from GS and PS were equal, but GS led to significantly lower genetic variance. This shows that while GS and PS can lead to equal rates of short-term gains, GS can reduce genetic variance more rapidly. Further work to develop efficient GS implementation strategies in spring wheat is warranted.},

Best linear unbiased prediction of the performance of single crosses, based on (i) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) data on the parental inbreds and (ii) yield data on a related set of single crosses, was evaluated. Yields of m single crosses were predicted as YM = C V−1 yP, where: yM = m × 1 vector of predicted yields of missing (i.e., no yield data available) single crosses; C = m × n matrix of genetic covariances between the missing and predictor hybrids; V = n × n matrix of phenotypic variances and covariances among predictor hybrids; and yP = nn × 1 vector of predictor hybrid yields corrected for trial effects. From a set of 54 single crosses, made between six Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (SSS) and nine non-SSS inbreds, 100 different sets of n = 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 predictor hybrids were chosen at random. Pooled correlations between predicted and observed yields of the remaining (54 − n) hybrids ranged from 0.654 to 0.800. The correlations were slightly higher when dominance variance was included in the model or when coefficients of coancestry were determined from RFLP rather than pedigree data. The correlations remained relatively stable across different, arbitrary values of genetic variances. The results suggested that single-cross yield can be predicted effectively based on parental RFLP data and yields of a related set of hybrids.},

Phytozome provides a view of the evolutionary history of every plant gene at the level of sequence, gene structure, gene family and genome organization, while at the same time providing access to the sequences and functional annotations of a growing number (currently 25) of complete plant genomes, including all the land plants and selected algae sequenced at the Joint Genome Institute, as well as selected species sequenced elsewhere. Through a comprehensive plant genome database and web portal, these data and analyses are available to the broader plant science research community, providing powerful comparative genomics tools that help to link model systems with other plants of economic and ecological importance.}",

Although several scientific giants examine how to handle the enormous pile of information in their cupboards, the problem remains unsolved. On a daily basis, there is a massive quantity of permanent loss of extensive information due to infrastructure and storage space problems.  The motivation for sequencing has fallen behind. Sometimes, the time that is spent to solve storage space problems is longer than the one dedicated to collect and analyse data. To bring sequencing to the foreground, scientists have to slide over such obstacles and find alternative ways to approach the issue of data volume. Scientific community experiences the data crisis era, where, out of the box solutions may ease the typical research workflow, until technological development meets the needs of Bioinformatics. },
